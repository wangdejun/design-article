<h1>你的App中有这10个错误吗？</h1>

<p>No matter what type of app you are creating, have created, or plan to create, design mistakes can be lethal when it comes to adoption and usage. Users want to download apps that are fun, functional and offer value during multiple uses. Users also want apps that are aesthetically pleasing and don’t require a lot of effort to interact with.</p>
无论你正在打算或已经设计了一个App,或者已经创造过多个不同种类的App,你应该知道设计错误是不能容忍的，设计失误对一款App的易用性和接受度是致命打击。无论何时，用户从来都选有趣的，优美的，能无脑使用的App。
<p>The problem for designers is that sometimes we are so close to a project that we miss glaring mistakes in design and usability because we know how it works. Today, we’re going to help you make a mental checklist of mistakes to look for and avoid in app design.</p>
<p>问题是设计师已经陷进去了，有时候忽略了错误和易用性，因为他们知道怎么使用,现在我们就来盘点下那些App设计中容易犯的错误。</p>
<p>(Note: All the included designs are from apps that are doing it right, so you get a good dose of visual inspiration.)</p>
<p>(记得下面的设计样例都是正确的，你可以活得很好的视觉刺激)</p>

<h1>错误1：第一观感差评</h1>

<img src = "https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/accuweather.jpg" />
<p>A good app starts with a good first impression. It should go without saying, but if users are turned off by your download page or initial impression when they open the app, chances are they won’t interact with it again. It is vital to make a great first impression.
好的App有好的第一印象，这不用说，但是如果下载页或者打开App的首屏就让用户不爽，他们不会继续下去，第一印象最重要！
</p>

<p>The home screen should load quickly and provide an easy to understand and distinct action for users. Tell them what they are here to do. Remind them of the reason they downloaded the app in the first place.
	首页应该加载迅捷，并且让用户非常容易地明白要怎样做，用这个App能做什么;把放在重要度第一位
</p>

<p>The necessary actions should be easy to find and perform and should all live in a neat and organized container that reflects the visual style of your brand and the rest of the app content.</p>

<h2>错误2.没有操作暗示</h2>

<img src = "https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/boomerang.jpg" />
<p>你的App是用来做什么的？你通过怎样的方式来把这些传达给你的用户？</p>
<ol>需要怎样操作？点击屏幕哪里？点击之后的预期是什么？设计需要帮助用户准确理解交互动作。谈到把这些暗示视觉化的时候，我们需要回归到设计的基本：
	<li>色彩：如果是可点击元素，高饱和度明艳的色彩能抓人眼球。</li>
	<li>空间：关键元素（控件）周围要留够空间，让用户能够一眼看到，容易操作。</li>
	<li>字体：使用简洁的字体，统一的描边宽度，适合屏幕展示的文字大小，所有提示性的信息不能晦涩难懂。</li>
</ol>



<h2>错误3.凌乱无序</h2>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/monument-1.jpg" alt="">
<p>
	对很多App来说，混乱是最大的问题，似乎设计师想把一个App上每个单独的设计都堆到一屏上。
</p>

<p>无论是游戏也好，工具应用也好，信息流App也好，一定要把这种想法丢掉!</p>

<p>
	App是在一个非常之小的屏幕上设计的，一次塞太多东西会使用户望而却步。
</p>

<p>Think of each “screen” as a single container for a single element. When you move to the next screen, a new bit of information can be displayed. Users will swipe and scroll if the content is engaging. And they are even more likely to do so if the design is clean and easily accessible.
	试着把"一屏"想象成只存放一个元素的容器，你划到下一屏，新的信息展示出来，
</p>

<p>错误4.触控元素过小或者太近</p>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/streaks-1.jpg" alt="">
<p>Beware of fat fingers. Elements that are too close together or too small to tap without zooming are a problem for users.</p>

<p>Ensure that there is plenty of space around each element to help eliminate inadvertent clicks. There’s no magic formula for this space, but when it is wrong you will know it. (Just peek at your analytics.)</p>

<p>Here’s how I created my scale. I borrowed a friend with large hands. Drew a circle around his forefinger and that’s my guideline. The button doesn’t have to be that size, but the tappable area should be. And nothing should be any closer.</p>

<p>Because of this, cards and container elements to click for actions are nice. This means that anywhere you tap in an area related to the content all take the user to the same location. (It’s design friendly and user friendly.)</p>

<p>5. Nonstandard Icons or Actions
让人费解的图标或动作提示
</p>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/colorswitch.jpg" alt="">

<p>There’s no reason to recreate iconography for your projects. The Facebook link is supposed to be an “f” inside a button; Twitter should be represented by a bird. Why? Because every user know exactly what these elements are and what they do. So why would you change it?</p>

<p>Incorporate standard iconography and actionable cues in the design. It will save you time and will help prevent user frustration.</p>

<p>错误6. 设计不连贯一致，缺乏整体性，</p>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/twitter-app.jpg" alt="">

<p>Everything within a single app should look and work in the same manner. As a user navigates deeper into the interface, he or she should start to have an expectation of what is to come and how it works.
一个App内的所有东西无论看起来还是用起来都应该是一致的。随着用户使用者渐渐习惯这个App。
</p>

<p>As they learn the app, it needs to meet those expectations aesthetically and operationally. This includes everything from color and type choices to user tools and how they work.</p>

<p>7. Incomplete Feedback Loops
不闭合的反馈循环
</p>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/wunderlist.jpg" alt="">

<p>Every interaction should be met with an equal and opposite reaction. (It’s one of the laws of digital physics, right?)</p>

<p>Feedback gives the user a sense of control with engaging with an app and it provides you with valuable information about how users engage. Feedback also helps users make decisions and makes the interface easy.</p>

<p>The feedback loop should:</p>

<p>Tell users where they are or show their current state. (Example: Hover state color changes.)</p>
<p>Respond when an action is executed (this includes success and failure). (Example: Success notification when a form is submitted.)</p>
<p>Tell users what is happening or what should happen next. (Example: Navigation arrows or a loading progress swheel.)</p>
<p>8. Not in Sync with the Platform</p>

<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/insta-logo.jpg" alt="">

<p>app design
<p>Are you an iPhone or Android user? Ask this question in a crowded room and you will get plenty of impassioned responses. Remember this when you design and release an app.</p>
<p>It should be in sync with the aesthetics of the platform where it is downloaded. That might even include two slightly different versions of the app.</p>

<p>Android and iOS guidelines will help you do this pretty easily. But you have to take the full interface into consideration. Just think about that lonely skeuomorphic app icon on your iPhone home screen that begs to be deleted. Say what you want about the new Instagram logo, for example, but it actually matches the interface now.</p>

<p>9. Interface is Too Complicated
交互界面太复杂</p>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/dunkin.jpg" alt="">

<p>It’s a common problem with gaming apps – they are way too complicated. By the time you figure it out, you don’t want to play anymore.</p>

<p>The interface should be simple. It should be scannable. It should be easy to understand and operate without an owner’s manual.</p>

<p>Anything else is just too complicated.</p>

<p>For most users, and app is downloaded to solve a problem. Each app is one solution. (You don’t use the same app as an alarm and to play a game, do you?) Remember that when you are in the design phase. What is the problem you are trying to solve? Solve it and move on.</p>

<p>10. Forgetting to Set Defaults忘记默认设置</p>
<img src="https://designshack.net/wp-content/uploads/uber-2.jpg" alt="">
<p>Default values in forms and interactive elements can be a big help for users. Consider them to be a small-scale visual walkthrough. Default values can include anything from a pre-marked preference (most-common choice or a null option) in lists and check boxes, instructional text in entry fields or any other example illustrating what is supposed to happen.</p>

<p>Defaults are helpful because they can make things easier for the user by showing them how to use the app, providing an option for users who are uncertain (as in the case with a null default) and by speeding up the entire interaction.</p>

<p>Defaults are also a good bit of feedback for you as well, particularly for forms, because they help cut down on the number of errors and with a “null” option, you immediately know the user did not make a selection.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to put your great app idea in action. You can use this post as a checklist or reminder to help you through the quality control process to ensure that your app is as good as it can be visually and in terms of usability. Good luck!</p>
